## Overview

### Controller(s):
Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning the appropriate response.
They act as intermediaries between the user interface (usually the web browser or mobile app) and
the backend services. Controllers receive the requests, extract the necessary data, and invoke the
appropriate services to process the request. They also handle any necessary data transformations and
return the response to the client.

Best practices for controllers include:

* Keeping them lightweight: Controllers should focus on request handling and delegate complex logic to
  other components, such as services.

* Following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each controller should have a clear and well-defined
  purpose, handling requests related to a specific resource or functionality.

* Using appropriate HTTP methods: Map the controller methods to the appropriate HTTP methods
  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) based on the desired behavior.

### Model(s):
Models represent the data structures used within the application. They define the structure,
attributes, and behavior of the data entities. Models encapsulate the data and provide methods
to manipulate and access that data.

Best practices for models include:

* Designing models based on the domain requirements: Models should accurately represent the concepts
and entities in the application's domain.

* Keeping models decoupled from the persistence layer: Models should not have direct dependencies on 
database or persistence-related code. Use separate entities or data transfer objects (DTOs) for persistence concerns.

### Services:
Services contain the business logic of the application. They handle complex operations, coordinate
interactions between different components, and perform data manipulation or processing tasks.
Services encapsulate reusable and independent units of functionality.

Best practices for services include:

* Keeping services focused and cohesive: Each service should have a specific responsibility or
functionality and avoid becoming overly complex.

* Applying the Dependency Injection (DI) principle: Services should rely on interfaces rather than
concrete implementations, allowing for easier testing and decoupling from specific implementations.

* Enforcing transactional boundaries: Use transactions to ensure data consistency when multiple
operations need to be performed atomically.

### Data Access Model (DAO)
DAO (Data Access Object) is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application and the underlying data source, typically a database. DAOs encapsulate the logic for accessing and manipulating data, promoting separation of concerns and modularity in the application.

Best practices for DAOs include:

* Single Responsibility: Each DAO should have a specific responsibility related to data access for a particular entity or set of entities. Avoid including unrelated functionalities to keep the DAO focused and cohesive.

* Interface-based Design: Define DAO interfaces that specify the contract for data access operations. This allows for loose coupling between the DAO and the rest of the application, enabling easier testing and swapping of implementations.

* Dependency Injection (DI): Apply DI principles to inject DAO dependencies into other components, such as services or controllers. This promotes flexibility, modularity, and testability by allowing different DAO implementations to be easily substituted.

* Avoid Business Logic: DAOs should primarily focus on data access and manipulation, while complex business logic should be placed in separate service components. Separating concerns improves maintainability and testability, allowing DAOs to be more reusable.
